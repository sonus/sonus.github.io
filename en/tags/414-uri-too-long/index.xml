(If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, you can catch up on the basics and benefits here: &amp;ldquo;Fixing Heavy JWTs: Bitmasking for Lean &amp;amp; Scalable Permissions&amp;rdquo;). We saw how a single 64-bit integer could compactly represent up to 64 distinct permissions, slashing your token size from hefty kilobytes down to a few hundred bytes. That&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer!
But what if you&amp;rsquo;re building a massive system with hundreds, or even thousands, of super-granular permissions across multiple modules or services?</description></item><item><title>Fixing Heavy JWTs: Bitmasking for Lean &amp; Scalable Permissions</title><link>https://sonus.xyz/en/page/fix-heavy-jwts-bitmasking-scalable-permissions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sonus.xyz/en/page/fix-heavy-jwts-bitmasking-scalable-permissions/</guid><description>Ever hit a wall with an error message that just screams, &amp;ldquo;Dude, you&amp;rsquo;re sending too much data!&amp;rdquo; Or maybe your shiny, new Single Page Application (SPA) suddenly starts acting weird, requests dropping like flies? Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve been there. For us, the culprit turned out to be our good old friend, the JSON Web Token (JWT), specifically when it got absolutely packed with permissions and claims. What started as a neat, efficient way to handle authorization quickly spiraled into a monster that was literally too big for its britches.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Heavy JWTs: Bitmasking for Lean &amp; Scalable Permissions</title><link>https://sonus.xyz/en/blog/fix-heavy-jwts-bitmasking-scalable-permissions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 04:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sonus.xyz/en/blog/fix-heavy-jwts-bitmasking-scalable-permissions/</guid><description>Ever hit a wall with an error message that just screams, &amp;ldquo;Dude, you&amp;rsquo;re sending too much data!&amp;rdquo; Or maybe your shiny, new Single Page Application (SPA) suddenly starts acting weird, requests dropping like flies?
